      "abstract": "A GC\u00e2\u0080\u0093MS/MS method with EI ionization was developed and validated to detect and quantify N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and seven other nitrosamines in 105 samples of metformin tablets from 13 different manufactures. Good linearity for each compound was demonstrated over the calibration range of 0.5\u00e2\u0080\u00939.5 ng/mL. The assay for all substances was accurate and precise. NDMA was not detected in the acquired active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); however, NDMA was detected in 64 (85.3%) and 22 (91.7%) of the finished product and prolonged finished product samples, respectively. European Medicines Agency recommends the maximum allowed limit of 0.032 ppm in the metformin products. Hence, 28 finished products and 7 pronged dosage products were found to exceed the acceptable limit of daily intake of NDMA contamination. The implications of our findings for the testing of pharmaceutical products are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate whether fraction from Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) could reduce immunotoxicity and enhance antitumor activity of doxorubicin (Dox) in mice. A water-soluble LBP fraction, designated LBP3, was isolated from edible Chinese herbal Lycium barbarum and used in this study. To investigate the effect of LBP3 on Dox-induced immunotoxicity, tumor-free mice were used and treated with either normal saline, Dox, or Dox plus LBP3. To investigate the effect of LBP3 on antitumor activity of Dox, H22 tumor-bearing mice were used and treated with either normal saline, Dox, LBP3, or Dox plus LBP3. The results showed that LBP3 did not protect against the body weight loss caused by Dox, but it promoted the recovery of body weight starting at day 5 after Dox treatment in tumor-free mice. LBP3 also improved peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, promoted cell cycle recovery in bone marrow cells, and restored the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. Furthermore, in H22 tumor-bearing mice, LBP3 enhanced antitumor activity of Dox and improved peripheral blood lymphocyte counts and the cytotoxicity of splenocytes. In brief, our results demonstrated that LBP3 could reduce the immunotoxicity and enhance antitumor activity of Dox.",
