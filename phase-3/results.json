      "title": "N-Nitrosodimethylamine Contamination in the Metformin Finished Products",
      "abstract": "A GC\u00e2\u0080\u0093MS/MS method with EI ionization was developed and validated to detect and quantify N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and seven other nitrosamines in 105 samples of metformin tablets from 13 different manufactures. Good linearity for each compound was demonstrated over the calibration range of 0.5\u00e2\u0080\u00939.5 ng/mL. The assay for all substances was accurate and precise. NDMA was not detected in the acquired active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); however, NDMA was detected in 64 (85.3%) and 22 (91.7%) of the finished product and prolonged finished product samples, respectively. European Medicines Agency recommends the maximum allowed limit of 0.032 ppm in the metformin products. Hence, 28 finished products and 7 pronged dosage products were found to exceed the acceptable limit of daily intake of NDMA contamination. The implications of our findings for the testing of pharmaceutical products are discussed.",

Fitness varies along two phenotypic axes, with the maximum fitness located, for convenience, at the origin of these axes.

At any specific fitness, there are a number of other phenotypic combinations that have equivalent fitness; the values of these phenotypic combinations establish the fitness isoclines (black circle). From the optimum, fitness declines monotonically according to the structure of the landscape (see text).
